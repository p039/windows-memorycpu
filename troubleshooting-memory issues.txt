There are two types of memory pressure to consider:

1. First - a system with too little physical RAM installed.

When a system has too little RAM, the Virtual Memory Manager has an increased workload as it attempts to keep
the most recently accessed virtual memory pages of processes in Physical RAM so that they can be quickly retrieved.
Performance of both applications, and the overall system may suffer as a result of the --INCREASED PAGING TO DISK--.
Although the excessive paging is really a secondary symptom, it is the easiest symptom to detect.

2. Second - process exhausts the available virtual memory.



Monitor memory leaks:

-Private Bytes counter indicates the total amount of memory that a process has allocated,
not including memory shared with other processes.

-Virtual Bytes counter indicates the current size of the virtual address space that the process is using.

Summary: Some memory leaks appear in the data file as an increase in private bytes allocated.
Other memory leaks show up as an increase in the virtual address space.
